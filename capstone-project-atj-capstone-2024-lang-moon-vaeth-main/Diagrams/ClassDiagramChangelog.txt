Renamed Classes:
	-Main was renamed to Game to better reflect its purpose
	-World was renamed to Level to better reflect its purpose
New Classes:
	-CanvasLayer added as new base class
	-Inventory
	-Warrior, Rogue, Mage, Archer (placeholder class types)
	-PlayerUI is an individual UI for each player, reflecting
	future multiplayer capability
	-Collectible and Powerup
	-Texture
	-InputGUI consolidates all menu management into one class
	-PhysicsProperties is a potential name for a class that
	could hold complex physics values if multiple classes
	will need to calculate/hold them. We may end up just
	delegating these properties out to the individual classes
	that require them
	-Hazard
	-AudioManager
	-SaveSystem
Modified Classes:
	-Player has been made more robust, and now has a levelling
	system, inventory, and possible Class Types
	-Enemy has been expanded, now implementing physics and potential
	'AI' or tracking mechanisms (not sure how this will work yet).
	-Game has possible 4 players now, and manages the InputGUI and
	the textures, as well as now having a save system
	-World is now Level, which contains all the things a level of
	our game will need to have.

Notes were added to classes that required extra description.
